# Tool Collection Overview

- Each folder contains a specific tool or application.
- These tools are my small contribution to provide free resources or solutions that were hard to find.
- The tools are simple and designed for small-scale applications, making them accessible for various use cases.

## Current Tools
- **'create_srt' tool**: 
  - A GUI that allows you to load timestamps and content to generate an SRT file for video subtitles.
  
- **Binary/ASCII art tool**: 
  - Converts an existing image into binary or ASCII-based art with adjustable threshold using a slider.
  
- **Mathematical theory tool**: 
  - Visualizes and proves a specific math theory.

## Future Development
- These tools are small programs that donâ€™t yet require full-scale projects or repositories.
- If any of these tools grow in scope, they can be migrated to separate Git repositories in the future.
- Currently, there are only three types of tools, but more may be added later.
